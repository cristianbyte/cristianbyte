        I recently watched a video by PewDiePie, one of my favorite YouTubers,
        anyway, he had just built his new computer and he was talking about how
        he is not a tech guy, but he is curious about technology. Like almost
        every youtuber he recorded all the process of building his new computer.
        He said that he was worried about how he had protected his data and his
        guy (his baby(so cute)).
      </p>

      <p>
        The point here is that someone like him, and you and me, is curious
        about technology, and he built, and installed Linux. Yes, yes...
        Linux... Isn't that strange? So all the fandom around Linux started to
        talk about that (also me).
      </p>

      <p>
        And I am going to make a parenthesis here, because building a computer
        is not a big deal, when you have some knowledge about it; for example;
        If you search a little bit, you will see that you only need to connect 7
        parts(Ram, CPU, Motherboard, Power Supply, Storage, Case, Cooling) to
        make a computer work, and you can do it in a single day... almost.

        <br />

        But, again that's not the point, when you do some stuff like that I
        really think that is the beginning of a new path, a new journey. When
        you do stuff like that, you are in another universe, just you and the
        process, searching on internet, reading, watching videos, and you have a
        goal: build a computer(almost). And that’s where the magic happens.
      </p>

      <p>
        And again, that's not the point of this post... In this world, where
        every day we see new AI news, a new AI tool, a new AI model, we are in
        the middle of a revolution... and it's inevitable that at some point AI
        will be able to do almost anything. But I really think it's still far
        from being capable when it comes to creativity. Let's remember that AI
        models are currently trained and based on formulas, mathematical models,
        and a lot of probability — and they are really good at that — but how do
        you transpose calculation into creativity? How do you put creativity
        into a formula? How do you make an AI capable of having a reason? Maybe
        that will be the trigger, and maybe an AI, on its own, will discover
        that formula. But until it has it clearly defined, it won’t be able to
        be creative.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything starts with a single step, and now PewDiePie is building his
        own devices, just like we see in science fiction movies, where things
        are built out of "junk." That's where we are truly valuable. And then,
        AI will continue evolving and will become just another tool, while we
        remain the creators — the ones who carry the spark of curiosity and
        creativity.
